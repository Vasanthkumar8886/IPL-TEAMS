    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <P>The Governing Council of the Indian Premier League issued an invitation to tender for two new sides in August 2021. A total of 22 companies declared an interest, but with a high base price for the new teams, there were no more than six serious bidders. The Board of Control for Cricket in India allowed a consortium of three companies or individuals to bid for each franchise. The Sanjiv Goenka-owned RPSG Group won the rights to operate the Lucknow franchise with a bid of ₹7,090 crores.

        The team launched a competition to decide its name, from which the name Lucknow Super Giants was chosen in January 2022. Ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, the franchise drafted KL Rahul as their captain for ₹17 crore, making him the joint highest paid player in the league. The franchise also bought Marcus Stoinis and Ravi Bishnoi. The team unveiled their jersey on 23 March 2022 for the upcoming season.
        
        In May 2023, the owners decided to sport the iconic green-maroon jersey of ATK Mohun Bagan (later renamed as Mohun Bagan Super Giant) in their Kolkata fixture against Kolkata Knight Riders to pay tribute to the long, century-old and rich football history of Mohun Bagan. The football division of Mohun Bagan is currently co-owned by RPSG Group.</P>
