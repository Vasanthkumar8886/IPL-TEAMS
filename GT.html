    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The Governing Council of the Indian Premier League issued an invitation to tender for two new sides in August 2021. A total of 22 companies declared an interest, but with a high base price for the new teams, there were no more than six serious bidders. The Board of Control for Cricket in India allowed a consortium of three companies or individuals to bid for each franchise. CVC Capital Partners, a British private equity and investment advisory firm, won the rights to operate the Ahmedabad franchise with a bid of â‚¹5,625 crore (US$700 million).

        CVC Capital Partners has won the Ahmedabad franchise in the auction that was held in Dubai in October 2021.
        
        Ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, the franchise drafted Hardik Pandya as their captain. The franchise also picked Shubman Gill and Rashid Khan.
        
        The Ahmedabad franchise revealed the name of its cricket team as the Gujarat Titans on 9 February 2022.</p>
